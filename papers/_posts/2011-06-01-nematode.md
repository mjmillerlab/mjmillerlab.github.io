# Abstract
We report the first Panamanian record of Pelecitus helicinus, a nematode, which was
encountered as a parasite of the Orange-billed Sparrow (Arremon aurantiirostris,
Emberizidae) in Aguas Claras, Colón Province, which is also a new record for this
species as host of this P. helicinus. We extracted 27 nematodes from the
subcutaneous tissue of the tibia-tarsal joint and fingers of A. aurantiirostris. A list of
those birds that have been recorded as hosts of P. helicinus is given.
