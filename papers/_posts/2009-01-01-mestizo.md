# Abstract

The population genetics of the people of Panama have beenpreviously explored using traditional allozyme markers, but to date, nostudy has examined the utility of existing short–tandem repeat marker(STR) protocols for resolving forensic and paternity cases. The Panamanianpopulation constitutes a highly multi–racial and poly–ethnic group representingthree principle races: Amerindians, blacks and Caucasians, but alsocontaining an appreciable population of people with East Asian and MiddleEastern heritage. We analyzed genetics polymorphisms for the followingstandard STR loci: CSF1PO, TPOX, TH01, F13A01, FESFPS, VWA, D16S539,D7S820 and D13S317 in a population sample of unrelated mixed–race (mestizo)individuals who resided in Panama City. Genotypic distribution was inagreement with Hardy–Weinberg expectations (HWE) for eight of ninemarkers; D16S539 showed an excess of homozygotes that may be attributableto allelic dropout. Even when this locus is removed from analysis, theforensic value (e.g. power of discrimination, matching probability andpower of exclusion) of these markers among Panamanian mestizos is extremelyhigh. Overall, our study did not find evidence of substructure amongPanamanian mestizos, however with measures to correct the allelic dropoutof D16S539, the GenePrint STR Multiplex Systems (Silver Stain Detection)is appropriate for forensic and paternity applications in Panama
