# Abstract

Prior studies of mitochondrial variation in White-breasted Wood-Wrens (*Henicorhina leucosticta*) have suggested that populations in South American and Mesoamerica might represent multiple species. Here we report the complete mitochondrial genomes from two individuals of *H. leucosticta*, representing the Panamanian subspecies pittieri and alexandri. The two sequences were 16,721 and 16,726 base pairs in size with both genomes comprised of the usual 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, and one displacement loop region in the standard avian order. Uncorrected pairwise divergence between mitogenome features was high, with the highest divergence occurring in protein-coding genes (average = 8.2%), followed by control region (6.7%). RNA features had lower pairwise divergences (average tRNA = 4.3%, average rRNA = 2.3%). The protein-coding ATPase 6 gene had a different stop codon between these two specimens. The high level of sequence variation between these subspecies suggests that Mesoamerican *H. leucosticta* might be comprised of multiple species. We urge a full phylogeographic survey of this widespread Neotropical forest bird.
