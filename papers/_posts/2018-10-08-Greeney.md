# Abstract

The Cordilleran Flycatcher (*Empidonax occidentalis*) is one of many North American birds whose distribution crosses
the USâ€“Mexican border and for which little is presently known about summer distribution and breeding biology south of this
border. In addition, the Cordilleran Flycatcher presents ornithologists with a number of challenging questions surrounding its
taxonomy, migration, distribution, population structure, and species limits. In particular, there remains a good deal of uncertainty
concerning the species-level relationships, seasonal movements, and the wintering and breeding distributions of both
recognized subspecies of Cordilleran Flycatcher in Mexico. Using field observations, a thorough review of the literature, and
the examination of several distributional databases, we compile current knowledge on Mexican populations during the summer
months and emphasize directions for future research. We document the northern limit of confirmed breeding Cordilleran
Flycatchers in Mexico and point to gaps in our understanding of its summer range south of the US border. Currently available
data point to a potential migratory divide in northern Mexico, which has implications for species limits and evolutionary dynamics
within the Cordilleran Flycatcher.
