# Abstract
We present a preliminary list of birds collected on the Caribbean coast of the province of Veraguas, Panama. Here, we found birds not known from the area, instead they were believed to range limits ending either east or west of our collection site. These include: *Cnipodectes subbrunneus*, *Juliamyia julie*, *Gymnopithys bicolor bicolor*, *Mionectes (oleagineus) affinis*, and western phylospecies of *Malacoptila panamensis* and *Xenops minutus*. Our results reaffirm that the coast of Veraguas is an important suture zone between Mesoamerica and South America avifaunas along the Caribbean coast of Panama.
