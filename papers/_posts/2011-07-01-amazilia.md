# Abstract
We surveyed the avifauna of the lowland and foothill habitats surrounding Piñas Bay, located on the Pacific coast of Darién Province, Panama from 3 May-16 May, 2003 as part of a general biological inventory sponsored by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Tropic Star Lodge. During the two weeks, we recorded 179 species, of which we collected 112 species. We recorded three restricted-range species, all near-threatened at the global level, and one globally-threatened species: Great Green Macaw. Furthermore, we collected two species at elevations substantially below previously published records for Panama, and we report the first instance of syntopic breeding condition Purple and Shining Honeycreepers (Cyanerpes sp.), as well as several first records of non-forest species for southwestern Darién Province.
