**Do you love Neotropical birds?** <br/>
**Do you love field expeditions in Latin America?** <br/>
**Want to do some serious genomics in one of the nation's best university-based natural history museums?**

I am recruiting  1-2 PhD students to join my lab in the Ornithology Department of the Sam Noble Museum at University of Oklahoma for the Fall 2017. Students should be willing to take a creative leadership role in the comparative genomics of secondary contact and speciation in Neotropical  birds. These positions would involve considerable time in the field on expeditions in Latin America to collect birds, supported by the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum Department of Ornithology. 

The ideal student will have previous Latin American ornithological field experience, as well as the ability to understand and speak Spanish. Students from Latin America are particularly encouraged to apply. These projects will also require developing genomic datasets that the student develops so using massively-parallel sequencing resources at the University of Oklahoma, so strong computational skills (UNIX, R and Python) are a real plus. However, all potential students with strong field, lab, and museum ornithological skills are encouraged to contact me. 

Students can undertake projects in two areas where we have existing datasets: either in the comparative genomics of secondary contact of lowlands birds (see [Secondary Contact Project](https://mjmillerlab.github.io/projects/post/seccon)) or in the genomics of species isolation of Lampornis hummingbirds (see [Lampornis Genomics Prooject](https://mjmillerlab.github.io/projects/post/seccon)), or the student can develop her/his own project. We have active funding for field research in Bolivia and Peru as well, so projects in this area could be developed.

Students in our lab are enrolled in either the Biology or closely allied Ecology and Evolutionary Biology PhD program, but maintain offices and a lab home in the Ornithology Department at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. The Ornithology Department consists of a fast-growing ornithological collection, state-of-the-art molecular genomics labs (capable of doing all NGS preparations including ddRAD-Seq, hybrid capture, and whole genome sequencing), multiple bioinformatics Linux workstations (as well as access to the OU Supercomputer), and an impressive ornithological research library.

OU Biology/EEB has a strong focus on “geographical ecology”,  and our group participates in the Geographical Ecology working group, which is organized by [Mike Kaspari](https://michaelkaspari.org/) (tropical community ecology), and includes the following faculty: [Katie Marske](http://www.ou.edu/cas/biology/people/faculty/katharine-marske.html) (phylogeography) [Katie Marshall](http://www.ou.edu/content/cas/biology/people/faculty/katie-marshall.html)  (physiological ecology), [Dan Allen](http://www.allenlab.org/#gae) (stream and riparian ecology) and [Cam Siler](http://cameronsiler.com/) (herpetology and systematics), which provide a rich environment for students in our group to  interact with these and other talented faculty and students in the Geographical Ecology working group and throughout the department.

Funding for graduate students is currently available in the form of 10-month teaching assistantships with resonable stipends, full tuition waivers and excellent health care coverage. In addition, students can expect to be funded during the summer by the OU Sutton Avian Research Scholarships, Adams Scholarships, and Curatorial Assistantships in Ornithology at the Sam Noble Museum. Our lab has existing funds for field expeditions and specimen collection, and there are several funding sources on campus and elsewhere for the development of next-generation genomic datasets.

Norman is an amazing college town, and the cost of living is quite reasonable for graduate students. The OU Biology Department is well-regard for it's collegiality and comradere.

Interested students should contact me (mjmiller@ou.edu) with a brief summary of your research interests and relevant experiences and attach a CV. All prospective students must also apply through the [OU Biology Graduate Program](http://www.ou.edu/content/cas/biology/graduate-studies.html) by mid December. Candidates from groups underrepresented in STEM are encouraged to apply. *Se habla español aqui!*
