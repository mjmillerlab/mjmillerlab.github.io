We've arrived in Norman! Our group is settling in to Norman, the University of Oklahoma, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History.

Over the summer, we will begin our first Great Plains collecting trip, return to Panama to export tissue duplicates back to our SNOMNH lab, and welcome Kevin and Krisangel to the group. It's also a time for me to finish all the old manuscripts that have been lingering.
