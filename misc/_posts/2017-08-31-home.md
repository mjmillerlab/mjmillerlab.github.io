There are two, related research themes in our group. The first is avian genomics. We ask questions about how bird species are formed, how they maintain reproductive isolation, what is the nature of hybridization between species, and the functional genomics of avian adaptation using cutting-edge genomic tools.

We also study emerging infectious disease. This interest initially arose from the fact that birds often move pathogens around landscapes. However, now our work in this field is broader, focusing on how we can leverage DNA sequencing technology and our expertise as field biologists to understand how pathogens are distributed in space and time, especially in the tropics.

Central to everything that we do is that are museum scientists: we blend specimen-based approaches with cutting-edge tools that have emerged during the “Age of DNA”.
