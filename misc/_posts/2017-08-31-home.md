Our group studies **avian genomics** and the ecology of emerging Neotropical **zoonotic diseases**. We are **museum scientists** that blend the traditional **specimen-based** approaches with cutting-edge tools that have emerged during the "**Age of DNA**". This provides remarkably powerful tools for investigating fundamental questions about the **processes that form and maintain species diversity**, as well as applied questions of **biodiversity conservation** and **global health**.

[Matthew Miller](/team/matthew-miller) is the Curator of the [Ornithology Department](http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/collections-and-research/ornithology/) at the [Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History](http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/), at the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/). Our group has an academic home in the [Department of Biology](http://www.ou.edu/cas/biology.html).

Our work is focused on Neotropical ecosystems and the **southern Great Plains**.
