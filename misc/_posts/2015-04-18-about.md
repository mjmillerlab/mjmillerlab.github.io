### Design and Implementation

This site was originally  inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site], as many other academics have my inspired by that site. The most recent flavor of this site comes from [Allan Drummond]'s site, which is a fork of the Bedford site. Allan's `lab` theme, is great for our use. 

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. If you use the code, please link back to [Trevor's site](http://bedford.io) and to [Allan's site](http://drummondlab.org/about.html).
