# Join the Lab

### Graduate Students
I am recruiting 1-2 PhD students to join my lab in the Ornithology Department of the Sam Noble Museum at University of Oklahoma for the Fall 2017. Students should be willing to take a creative leadership role in the comparative genomics of secondary contact and speciation in Neotropical birds. These positions would involve considerable time in the field on expeditions in Latin America to collect birds, supported by the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum Department of Ornithology.
Please see the full link [here](/blog/recruit)

### Undergraduates
Are you an OU Undergraduate? There are some great opportunities in our lab to learn museum science and management, molecular biology, and field ornithology. Please email me for details!

# Design and Implementation

This site was originally  inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site], as many other academics have my inspired by that site. The most recent flavor of this site comes from [Allan Drummond]'s site, which is a fork of the Bedford site. Allan's `lab` theme, is great for our use. 

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license. If you use the code, please link back to [Trevor's site](http://bedford.io) and to [Allan's site](http://drummondlab.org/about.html).
