Sidney is an Honors College undergrad in our lab. He comes from Edmond, OK. For his Honors research, Sidney is sequencing whole genomes of North American Meadowlarks (<i>Sturnella</i>) to understand their evolutionary history, tempo and mode of speciation, and to identify a set of markers useful for measuring introgression between Western and Eastern Meadowlarks. Sidney hopes to go to grad school in ornithology focusing on molecular approaches to understanding avian diversity.
