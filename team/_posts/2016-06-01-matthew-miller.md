I am the Assistant Curator of Ornithology at the [Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History](http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/collections-and-research/ornithology/) & Assistant Professor in the [University of Oklahoma](http://www.ou.edu/) [Department of Biology](http://www.ou.edu/cas/biology.html).

My research focuses on the diversification of Neotropical birds and the diseases they carry. I employ a variety of research methods, but the collection and use of museum voucher specimens is a central theme of my work. In 2008, I founded the Bird Collection at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and I maintain a research affiliation there and at INDICASAT-AIP (Panama). I am a Distinguished Member of Panama's National Board of Investigators (SNI).
