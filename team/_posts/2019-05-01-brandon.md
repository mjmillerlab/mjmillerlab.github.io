Brandon is a recent BS graduate in Biology from the University of Oklahoma. Brandon and his wife Ashley formed a passion for birdwatching, after Brandon took my Fall 2018 Ornithology course.

Brandon is now helping with whole genome sequencing of the Black-capped Vireo as part of a conservation genomic study of these birds led by our group, with funding from the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation.
