<p>I am the Assistant Curator of Ornithology at the <a href="http://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/collections-and-research/ornithology/">Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History</a> &amp; Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/">University of Oklahoma</a> <a href="http://www.ou.edu/cas/biology.html">Department of Biology</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on the diversification of Neotropical birds and the diseases they carry. I employ a variety of research methods, but the collection and use of museum voucher specimens is a central theme of my work. In 2008, I founded the Bird Collection at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, and I maintain a research affiliation there and at INDICASAT-AIP (Panama). I am a Distinguished Member of Panamaâ€™s National Board of Investigators (SNI).</p>
