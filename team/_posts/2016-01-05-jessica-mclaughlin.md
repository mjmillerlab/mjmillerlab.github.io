Jessica joined the lab as a PhD Student in Fall 2017. Originally from Dayton, OH, she moved to Alaska to pursue a degree in Wildlife Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2011, where she did undergraduate research in Antarctic icefish physiology and biochemistry. She also volunteered at the [University of Alaska Museum Ornithology Lab](http://www.universityofalaskamuseumbirds.org/), learning about specimen preparation and collections-based research. This led to her pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree investigating gene flow, divergence, and speciation in nine lineages of Beringian birds, advised by [Kevin Winker](http://www.kevinwinker.org/). 


For her PhD, she will be studying speciation, secondary contact, and mitonuclear incompatibilities in Panamanian birds.
