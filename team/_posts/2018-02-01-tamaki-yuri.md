Tamaki is the Collection Manager in the Ornithology Department of the Sam Noble Museum, where she is also the  Lab Manager for our Genetic Resources Core Facility . Tamaki has a PhD from the University of Michigan, where she worked on several high-profile projects in avian molecular biology and systematics.
