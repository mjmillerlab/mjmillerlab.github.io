Krisangel is a graduate student in the Biology Department at the University of Oklahoma. Previously, she was an undergraduate researcher in our group at Villanova University. In her time as an undergraduate she worked on mitogenome organization and exploring the evolution of cryptic species in tropical Panamanian birds. During the year between Villanova and Oklahoma, Kris completed a nine-month internship working with Dr. Robert Gilman's research group in Peru, where she studied ecological epidemiology related to the 2016 El Niño in northern Peru. 

As a graduate student she is researching the landscape ecology of the the urban–sylvatic transition of energing zoonotic diseases in eastern Panama.
