Kevin joined our group in August 2016. He comes from [Jeff Peter's lab](http://people.wright.edu/jeffrey.peters) at Wright State University, where he completed a Master's degree looking at the genomic divergence across multiple duck species (Genus: *Anas*) . As an undergraduate, Kevin worked on the genomics of plants in [Richard Moore's lab](http://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/biology/about/faculty/moore/index.html) at Miami University (Ohio), including measuring selection in papaya plants (Genus: *Carica*). 

Kevin joins our group with considerable genomics experience, both in the bench work of next-generation library prep, and with large-data manipulation and bioinformatics skills.  Kevin has strong mastery of several analytical programming languages including python, perl, and R.

At the Sam Noble Museum, Kevin will apply his genomics tool set to looking at the comparative genomics of avian hybridization. He is excited to learn the arts of museum ornithology, and we are excited to have him teach us advanced skills in bioninformatical analysis.
