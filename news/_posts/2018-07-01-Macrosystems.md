We successfully amplified COI and sequenced the DNA barcode fragment of from [12 NEON pitfall traps](https://michaelkaspari.org/2017/09/18/toward-a-macroecology-of-some-of-the-little-things-that-run-the-world/) as the first step in our [NSF Funded Macrosystem Project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1702426). Sequencing was done using the [Oxford Nanopore Minion](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) in MJM's kitchen.
