 My wife, Peggy, has been battling Hodgkin's Lymphoma for the past six months, and has been undergoing chemotherapy for the last five months. Today her doctor informed us that she is in remission and she shows no sign of active cancer. Thank you to everyone who supported us during Peggy's treatment, and I especially want to thank my lab for your patience during this time.s
