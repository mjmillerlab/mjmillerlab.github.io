MJM along with four other OU Geographical Ecologists: [Mike Kaspari](https://michaelkaspari.org/), [Cam Siler](http://cameronsiler.com/), [Katie Marshall](https://www.beta.marshall-lab.com/), and [Mike Weiser](weiser.ou.edu) were granted a five year [NSF Macrosystem Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1702426) to develop non-invasive DNA sequencing and spatial imaging technologies to estimate species richness and biomass from [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/) pitfall bycatch. With this data, we hope to quantify and predict how Earth's great abiotic drivers--temperature, precipitation, and biogeochemistry--govern how ecological communities of soil insects vary from place to place.
