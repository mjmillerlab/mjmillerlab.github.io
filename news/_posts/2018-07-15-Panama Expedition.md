 Caio and MJM visited Jose Loaiza and [INDICASAT](http://indicasat.org.pa/home/) in July. We traveled to [Meteti, Darien](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Meteti,+Panama/). We did some in the field amplification of mosquitoes mtDNA and their viral pathogens. Later, Jessica and MJM traveled to Veraguas near [Rio Luis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/RÃ­o+Luis,+Panama/) to collect birds near the coast.
