I am traveling for a month to [INDICASAT](http://www.indicasat.org.pa/home/) in Panama to collaborate with my BCE (best collaborator ever) [Jose Loaiza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose_Loaiza) to work on some fascinating climate change models for zoonotic disease vectors, interact with my PhD student, Celestino Aguilar, and begin a new project with two Swarthmore undergrads, May Dong and Robert Huang on a proteomic tick identification preliminary project. It's going to be a wild month in Panama.
