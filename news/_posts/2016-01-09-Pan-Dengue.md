title:  Pan-Dengue meeting, April 2016, Panama City
author: Matthew Miller

I have been invited to give an oral presentation of our [*Aedes albopictus* expansion paper](http://mj-miller.net/papers/miller-plosNTD/) at the upcoming Pan-Dengue meeting sponsored by the [Gorgas Memorial Institute](http://www.gorgas.gob.pa/) in Panama City. It's always fun to return to my adopted homeland and meet up with friends and collaborators.

Given the controversial nature of our paper, I'm expecting a some fireworks at the talk. But, it's important to remember that everyone shares the goal of controlling, if not eliminating, serious vector-borne diseases such as dengue and Chikungunya...we just have different professional opinions on the best way to do that.
