Krisangel Lopez, a former Villanova student collaborator, arrives in Lima, Peru for a 9 month internship with [Robert Gilman's International Health research group](http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/915/robert-gilman). Please take a moment and read about the wonderful work that [La Familia Gilman](http://magazine.jhsph.edu/2012/spring/features/la-familia-gilman/page-1/) is doing in Peru and Bolivia at the intersection of medicine, public health, development, and ecology! Bob is a hero of mine, and one day I hope to have just a fraction of the impact that he's had using science to make the world a better place. I'm so happy that Krisangel gets to learn from the best!
