 The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation has funded a pilot research project in our lab to investigate population structure and inbreeding depression in Oklahoma Black-capped Vireos. This is a collaboration with Ornithology Research Associate [https://samnoblemuseum.ou.edu/staff/joseph-a-grzybowski/](Joe Grzybowski). We will be re-sequencing whole genomes for this project. [Brandon Alacr√≥n](/team/brandon) will assist on the project.
