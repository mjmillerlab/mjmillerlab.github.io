Three members of our research group traveled to Anchorage, Alaska to participate in the 2019 American Ornithological Society meeting. [Jessica McLauglin](/team/jessica-mclaughlin) participated in a symposium on hybrid zones and I gave a symposium talk on using genomics to evaluate species limits. [Sidney Vong](/team/sidney-vong) enjoyed a bunch of talks and got to talk to lots of ornithologists.
