Dr. Loaiza is a disease ecologist with expertise in vector-borne pathogens. He has a strong interest in viewing infectious disease as a system incorporating human, animal and wildlife health, in the context of the environment. His focus combines ecological field studies with laboratory-based investigations of disease pathogens, their vectors and hosts to understand their interactions and potential for disease emergence. Jose has also proficiency on population genetics, phylogeography, ecological niche modeling and genomics. 

Jose was trained in Medical Entomology (M.S.) at the University of Panama (2004). Later, under the direction of Drs. Marilyn Scott and Jan E. Conn (New York State Department of Health), he received his Ph.D. degree in Molecular Entomology from McGill University, Canada (2010). Jose has been an Assistant Professor of the school of Biology (University of Panama) for more than 15 years. In 2013, The Panamanian Association for the Advancement of Science (APANAC), in collaboration with the World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), honored Jose with the APANAC-TWAS Young Investigator Award. During that year, he also became a Member of the National Board of Investigators (SNI) under the category of National Investigator. More recently, Dr. Loaiza became a Staff Scientist at INDICASAT-AIP (2014) and was became a Research Associate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (2015).

Jose is collaborating with our group on several projects in emerging vector-borne disease ecology in Panama and South America. Jose and Matt co-advise several graduate students.
