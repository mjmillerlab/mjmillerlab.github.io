<h4 class="media-heading">Variable Mountain-gems</h4>
The Variable Mountain-gems of Costa Rica and Panama have long presented a taxonomic enigma to systematists. Typically, two species are recognized in the complex, based on male throat color: purple or white. However, our group has recently described a new member of the complex from the Azuero Peninsua in southern Panama (Miller, Buitrago et al. in prep.), which challenges the primacy of throat color as the <i> sine qua non</i> character for delimiting species.
<br/>
<br/>
During this work, we have also uncovered an enigma. In the Talamanca mountains of Panama and Costa Rica, white-throated and purple-throated birds share both mitochondrial and nuclear haplotypes, suggesting that speciation is recent. However, evidence from museum study skins suggests that hybridization is uncommon, despite ample opportunity for hybridization.
<br/>
<br/>
In late 2016 and early 2017, our group will be sequencing the whole genome of Variable Mountain-gems in order to develop a reference genome to understand the barriers to introgression and the drivers of speciation in these hummingbirds. We are hoping to recruit a graduate student to do resequencing of purple- and white-throated hummingbirds to unlock the mystery of speciation in this group!
