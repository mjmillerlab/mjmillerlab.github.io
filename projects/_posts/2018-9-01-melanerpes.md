# Species limits within the Golden-fronted – Red-bellied Woodpecker species complex

![](/assets/images/projects/melanerpes008.png)

For over half a century, ornithologists have debated how to interpret phenotypic variation in the Golden-fronted – Red-bellied Woodpecker species complex and closely related parapatric allies (<i>Melanerpes</i>) from North and Central America. This includes Velasquez’s Woodpecker (<i>M. santacruzi</i>), which some authorities have treated as conspecific with the Golden-fronted Woodpecker (<i>M. aurifrons</i>).

We have generated genome-wide ddRAD-seq loci to reconstruct historical demography and to estimate historical and contemporary patterns of gene flow in this group. Our data a sister-species relationships between Red-bellied and Golden-fronted Woodpeckers. The common ancestor of these two species is sister to Velasquez’s Woodpecker, which should be considered a seperate species from Golden-fronted Woodpecker. Using demographic models, we find no evidence for gene flow after speciation among these species. Finally, the genome-wide data suggests recent speciation for all three species, occurring between 100,000 and 500,000 years before present.




Analysis of birds collected in the Red-bellied/Golden-fronted Woodpecker contact zone in SW Oklahoma and NW Texas show that hybridization is rare, and limited to F1 hybrids. This suggests that reproductive isolation has evolved extremely rapidly in this group.
